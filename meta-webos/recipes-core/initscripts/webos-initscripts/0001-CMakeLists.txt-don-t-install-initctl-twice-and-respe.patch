Subject: [PATCH] CMakeLists.txt: don't install initctl twice and respect
 WEBOS_INSTALL_BASE_SBINDIR

:Release Notes:
Fix QA issue with usrmerge in DISTRO_FEATURES.

:Release Notes:
* initctl was once installed in /usr/bin/initctl by webos_build_program
  and then again to /sbin/initctl by:
  install(TARGETS  DESTINATION /sbin)

* all utils were installed to /sbin even when sbindir is set to /usr/sbin
  with usrmerge in DISTRO_FEATURES, causing installed-vs-shipped QA:

ERROR: webos-initscripts-1.0-r0 do_package: QA Issue: webos-initscripts: Files/directories were installed but not shipped in any package:
  /sbin/restart
  /sbin/start
  /sbin/status
  /sbin/initctl
  /sbin/stop
Please set FILES such that these items are packaged. Alternatively if they are unneeded, avoid installing them or delete them within do_install.
webos-initscripts: 5 installed and not shipped files. [installed-vs-shipped]

initctl needs to stay in sbin, because /sbin/initctl is hardcoded
in many places (and I haven't found anything hardcoding the 2nd copy in /usr/bin/initctl):

bootd/2.0.0-18-r15/git/src/bootd/core/SignalManager.cpp
luna-surfacemanager/2.0.0-388-r59/git/modules/weboscompositor/input/waylandinputmethodmanager.cpp
activitymanager/3.0.0-40-r13/git/src/activitymanager/ActivityManagerApp.cpp
filecache/2.0.1-10-r6/git/src/CacheBase.h.in
mojoservicelauncher/3.0.2-7-r10/git/fork_server.js
...

and e.g. bootd fails in runtime like this:
Apr 28 17:45:28 rpi4 bootd[1172]: sh: /sbin/initctl: not found
Apr 28 17:45:28 rpi4 bootd[1071]: [] [pmlog] bootManager Boot {} SIGNAL_rest-boot-done
Apr 28 17:45:28 rpi4 bootd[1173]: sh: /sbin/initctl: not found
Apr 28 17:45:28 rpi4 bootd[1071]: [] [pmlog] bootManager Boot {} SIGNAL_boot-done
Apr 28 17:45:28 rpi4 bootd[1174]: sh: /sbin/initctl: not found
Apr 28 17:45:28 rpi4 bootd[1071]: [] [pmlog] bootManager BootSequencer {} Bootd's job is done
Apr 28 17:45:55 rpi4 bootd[1071]: [] [pmlog] <default-lib> LS_NOT_AN {} Enhanced ACG
Apr 28 17:45:55 rpi4 bootd[1071]: [] [pmlog] <default-lib> LS_NOT_AN {} [_LSCheckProvidedTrustedGroups] found group bit mask : 1
Apr 28 17:47:25 rpi4 bootd[1071]: [] [pmlog] <default-lib> LS_NOT_AN {} Enhanced ACG
Apr 28 17:47:25 rpi4 bootd[1071]: [] [pmlog] <default-lib> LS_NOT_AN {} [_LSCheckProvidedTrustedGroups] found group bit mask : 1

and then there is no UI and many services aren't started at all.

:Testing Performed:

:QA Notes:
N/A
